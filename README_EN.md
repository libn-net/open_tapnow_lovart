# KardoFlow: Open TapNow & Lovart

[English](README_EN.md) | [Simplified Chinese](README.md)

KardoFlow is the open-source version of TapNow & Lovart. Both are excellent and worth using products, but they are a bit expensive. The subscription model is insufficient, and you often need to top up points. Therefore, we developed this alternative product. Recharge as you go, pay only for what you use. Enterprise users can white-label and act as agents, while ordinary users can independently access cheap and stable upstream API channels. It supports Windows and Mac installation versions, cloud-hosted versions, Mini Programs, Apps, and H5. It also supports the access and distribution of upstream short drama orders!

#### Not Fake Open Source!

#### The code is currently a bit messy and I'm hesitant to show it. Everyone, please raise issues and provide feedback. We will open source it after optimizing it a bit. Secondary development will also be more comfortable then.
##### If you are an individual creator, we provide you with orders and the open-source product.
##### If you are a startup, feel free to repackage and sell it. We suggest white-labeling (the price is not expensive). We are responsible for providing you with upstream orders (short dramas, commercials, short videos, marketing graphics and text, ad materials), products, training, and after-sales service.
##### In the AI era, products themselves will never have core competitiveness. Mastering the supply end and consumption end of the supply chain is the core competitiveness. "One-person companies" without team support are merely tools for a few to harvest leeks. Everyone should keep their eyes open.
